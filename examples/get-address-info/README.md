# Overledger Search

This example contains one script to return the balance and sequence for addresses. Please note this feature is not supported by bitcoin.

## Building

In order to run the examples, first, make sure you have built the sdk by running the following command in the root folder of the project:

```
npm run build
```

## Running the scripts

Each script has a section at the beginning where a couple of variables need to be initialised. First, set a mappId and BPI key. Then you can just run:

```
node get-address-info.js
```
